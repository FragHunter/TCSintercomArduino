# TCSintercomArduino

Here are the sketches for the following youtube video.

The Different sketches can be used like this: 


OnlySendOneBell: Send one call command to a defined serial number, see video demo.

TCSparserUNO: use external comparator on Interrupt pin D2, can be used with TCS software

TCSparserUNOMitCOMP: use internal comparator of Arduino UNO on pin D6 and D7.



For all sketches see the Video for Schmeatic.

Happy Intercom Hacking!
